Certainly! Here's a README.md file for your Age and Gender Detection System project on GitHub:

# Age and Gender Detection System

This project utilizes OpenCV and deep learning models to detect and classify the age and gender of faces in images or video streams. It provides a real-time demonstration of age and gender recognition capabilities using pre-trained models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- argparse

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/age-gender-detection.git
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the necessary model files (`*.pb`, `*.prototxt`, `*.caffemodel`) and place them in the `constants/` directory as specified in the code.

## Usage

1. Run the script to start the age and gender detection:

```bash
python age_gender_detection.py --input path/to/input_file.ext --device cpu/gpu
```

- `--input`: Path to an input image or video file. Skip this argument to capture frames from a camera.
- `--device`: Specify the device for inference (`cpu` or `gpu`).

2. The program will display the input stream with bounding boxes indicating detected faces along with their predicted age and gender.
